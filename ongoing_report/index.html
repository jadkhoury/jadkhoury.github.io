Introduction
========

The goal of this project is to research and implement an efficient triangle and quad tessellation scheme. Both schemes are expected to run entirely on the GPU and to out-perform existing hardware implementations. In addition to learning research methodology and communication, the candidate will develop strong skills in modern GPU programming.

Advanced OpenGL 4.5 functionalities
================
Before starting to work on the project itself, I needed to understand and learn how to implement some more advanced features of OpenGL that I didn't needed before, such as Transform Feedback, Uniform Blocks / Uniform Buffers, Shader Storage Buffers, Atomic Counters and more. Therefore, the first few weeks of my thesis have been dedicated to acquiring more in-depth GPU programming skills. At the end of this period, I had a code base of 7 small self-contained programs that would serve me during the rest of the research. This section will briefly detail these implementations.

Implementation of QuadTrees on GPU
================
QuadTrees, and all LTrees in general, are by definition a recursive approach to space transversal optimization. Nevertheless, J. Dupuy presented in GPU Pro 5 an iterative implementation of QuadTrees on GPU using ping-pong buffer and updating the tree sequentially at each frame. To do so, we store the QuadTree as a list of *keys*, each representing a leaf of the tree. The keys are designed such that we can recover the whole QuadTree branch from the root to the leaf. Fig. [keys] gives a basic example: the first root triangle has been divided once, giving four children (or leaves): 0,1,2,3. Now if the triangle 3 gets divided once again, it creates 4 children, their keys being their parent's key appended with their position relative to their parent, giving 30, 31, 32, 33. As the QuadTree only stores leaves, the node 3 gets deleted and we add the four new children to the QuadTree. The opposite operation is also possible, _i.e._ the subdivision of the node 3 can be rolled back by merging the four children leaves. With this approach, one can then decode a key as a pile of ramifications and deduce the transformations corresponding to the leaf inside the QuadTree (_i.e_. translation and scaling for the Quad, and some additional rotations for the Triangle). This encoding and decoding is for now handled by the `ltree.glsl` shader written by J. Dupuy.

 More details can be found in the Chapter of GPU Pro 5 dedicated to this implementation. 


Subdiv Point (10 oct 2017)
-------------------------
Implementation of the QuadTree on GPU in Compute Shaders using J. Dupuy's ltree.glsl` shader to compute the keys and the transformations. In this demo, we see a set of points placed on a regular grid, corresponding to the QuadTree leaf position. When using the GUI's slider, we modify the traget subdivision level uniformly across the QuadTree. The Compute Shader then divides or merge the existing keys (one invocation per key) to match the desired subdivision level, and the render pass then decodes the list of the keys and use the obtained transformation as the points position. Everything shown is in unit space (from `(0,0)` to `(1,1)`)

* The number of keys stored is kept in an **Atomic Counter**

* The implementation is purely done in SSBOs (the VAOs are empty)

![Subdiv Points](images/videos/4-Subdiv_Points.mp4)

*Please note that the video compression makes some of the points flickers and disappear, while this is not present when running the program itself*

Subdiv Quads (11 Oct 2017)
-------------------------
This program is an augmentation of *Subdiv Point* with: 

* A 2 triangle mesh of a quad instead of points

* Implementation of a "modern" VAO for multiple attributes for the quad mesh (Direct State Access)

* Use of `glDrawElementsInstanced` to **draw instances of indexed triangles**. The number of quads is not read back from the QuadTree SSBO yet, but computed from the target subdivision level

* W toggles the GL Wireframe mode (GL_LINES)

![Subdiv Quads](images/videos/5-Subdiv_Quads.mp4)


 Subdiv Quads 2 (12 oct 2017)
-------------------------
This program is an augmentation of *Subdiv Quads*, but required a **complete re-write of the `ltree.glsl` shader** to suit a new way of storing the key. Instead of having 4 bits at the end of the 32 bits bitstring reserved to store the subdivision level of a given leaf, we now have a 1 stored in front of the key itself, which serve as most significant bit to recover the level of the leaf. This is when the project became more challenging, as I had to re-implement completely every function that manipulate the keys. The most complicated part definitely was the transformation recovery from a key. To do so, we read the bitstring 2 bits by 2 bits, from root to leaf (_i.e._ from left to right), and accumulate both scaling and translation until we arrive at the end of the key, where we return the computed transformations as a `mat3` (to be applied to homogeneous 2D points). 

* Implemented **own ltree** for quads

* More robust implementation on Compute Shader

* 2D transformation for the scale and translation of the quads stored in mat3

* Throw error and stop program if shaders don't compile at initialization


 Subdiv Triangles (13 oct 2017)
-------------------------
The original implementation of the QuadTree only handled quads. Triangles require more work since they also need rotation to fit inside the original "root" triangle. The transformation implementation still returns a mat3. Also note the colour of the triangle in function of the LoD.

*Once again the video compression is suboptimal and makes some of the lines almost disappear*

Adaptive LoD: Distance Based
================
Unitil now, every subdivision presented used an uniform level across the geometry, allowing us to explicitly define the target level and subdividing until that level is matched. Nevertheless, the goal of tessellation is to get a variable level of subdivision across the geometry. Usually, we aim at a fixed number of primitives (Triangles, Quads) per screen pixel. A good approximation of this ratio is to compute the LoD for a given primitive in function of the distance to the camera. To test this approach, I first implemented a simple 2D case where the position of the camera is simulated by a white point that can be displaced across the 2D scene using the keyboard arrows. Then I tested this approach in 2 different real-world application: procedural terrain from grids, and 3D mesh rendering. 

To avoid T-Junctions in the mesh (and therefore possible cracks in the rendering), a morph function is necessary for a smooth transition between two LoDs. This morph merges the vertices and edges of a subdivided primitive, say at level `n`, with the vertices and edges remaining in the same primitive at level `n-1`. The morphing is controlled by a float variable, let's call it `morphK` taking values from 0 to 1, corresponding respectively to not morphed at all, to completely merged. Now consider the LoD as discretely decreasing in function of the distance. The `morphK` control variable should be null at the lower bound distance of a given LOD, progressively increase, and  reach 1 before the next LoD step, _i.e._ before the distance becomes great enough that the LoD assigned to the primitive is 1 less. As a result, we get, at approximately half the distance between two LoDs, a smooth transition between the closer and the further LoD, thus avoiding T-Junctions.  For Quads, the morphing implemented is the one presented in [Strugar, F., 2009. Continuous distance-dependent level of detail for rendering height-maps. Journal of graphics, GPU, and game tools, 14(4), pp.57-74. paper]. As triangles are also rotated, this morphing needed modifications, and I therefore modified it to become symmetrical _w.r.t._ the axis of the subdivision pattern. 

 Subdiv RealTime 1 (27 oct 2017)
-------------------------
This is an augmentation of the *Subdiv Triangles* where 

* The instanced triangles are now drawn in **indirect mode**. 

* The Compute Shader (Compute Pass) is in charge, for each leaf key, to **estimate the distance-based LoD** corresponding to its position _w.r.t._ the position of the "camera" (simulated by the white point). In function of this LoD, it either merges 4 children into a parent, divide a leaf into 4 children, or simply copy the existing key. 

* At each key write in the SSBO, the Compute Shader **atomically increments** the number of instance to draw (corresponding to the number of QuadTree leaves) directly in buffers dedicated to store the **Indirect Draw Command**. The `commands buffers` are managed separately in a `Commands` class, as their ping-pong mechanism is slightly different (need to reset the counters to 0 each `n` frames ...)

* GUI augmented to allow **switching between uniform and adaptive LoD**

* Function to reinitialize the QuadTree (_i.e._ rebuild it from scratch in function of the position of the "camera")

* Switch from triangle to quad mode

* Implementation of the CDLOD morphing function for quads, research and implementation of my solution for triangle primitives.

* Use of more advanced Imgui features to show some real-time benchmark.

 Subdiv RealTime 2 (06 nov 2017)
-------------------------
This program is an augmentation of *Subdiv Realtime 1*. 

* Until now, all the subdivision were made on a single primitive explicitly defined in the QuadTree program. But the subdivision should work on any given 3D mesh. To suits this need, I implemented a **Mesh class** serving as interface between the "user" and the subdivision program. This class is in charge of loading the mesh, either from a _.obj_ file (for now), or generating it procedurally (for example: a grid). It then gives the the QuadTree program the list of vertices, quad indices and / or triangle indices, and the QuadTree program takes care of everything else. On the captured demo, the mesh is a simple 2 triangle quad, but the concept still applies: in addition to subdividing a given primitive, the program maps the primitive to its world-space position (mapping to its position on the mesh, then transforming using the model matrix). To verify that the mapping doesn't just work because of the unit space properties, I added some optional shear to the uploaded grid to test if the algorithm was robust to **non-identity model matrix**, and it was. 

* Since in the new implementation of the QuadTree leaf key, each subdivision takes 2 bits, and that the MSB representing the leaf subdivision level takes 2 bits also, the total number of subdivisions that allows the `int` format is 15 (`2 + 15 * 2 = 32 bits`). To overcome this limitation, I reimplemented every ltree function to be able to support a **`uvec2` key format**. As glsl doesn't offer the `long int` type, `uvec2` used properly can emulate a 64 bits integer by considering the two coordinates as concatenated. Some special operations have been reimplemented, in  particular left/right shift, findMSB, etc ... But the algorithm didn't change much. This now allows 31 subdivision levels (`2 + 31 * 2 = 64 bits`)

* Some modifications have been added to leave some space for the GUI

* In the LTree functions responsible for computing the transformation needed to map a leaf primitive to its place in the root primitive (*e.g.* map the unit triangle in the subdivided mesh triangle), rotation computations needed `cos` and `sin` evaluation (in OpenGL). But these operations are expensive and not very relevant when all angles are always a multiple of $\pi/4$, so I implemented a mul / add workaround to avoid these computations.

Subdiv Terrain (09 nov 2017)
-------------------------
* **Simulated camera** with a projection matrix, everything ported to 3D world-space

* Render to square **framebuffer** (`viewer` class)

* Grid size can be adjusted in the code

* Height displacement function from J.Dupuy

* Addition of a **Cull Pass**: for each QuadTree leaf, I create a bounding box of the primitive corresponding to the treated leaf, map it to its world space coordinates, and use a function from J.Dupuy's framework to test it against the VP matrix and deduce if it should be culled or not. Nevertheless, this cull also required to adapt the ping-pong approach of the buffers, since the culled primitives should still be accessible in the next Compute Pass. For example, if a triangle was not visible in a frame `f` and therefore culled, but is supposed to be visible at frame `f+1`, then the QuadTree should stil be able to access it and eventually merge / divide it. For this reason, the  ping-pong implementation in the `Command class` has been modified to suit these constraints. 

* To verify the validity of the Cull Pass visually, a `freeze` button has been implemented in the GUI, that makes the QuadTree program bypass the Compute and Cull pass, and as a result freezes the QuadTree.

Subdiv Mesh (17 nov 2017)
-------------------------
As before, this is an augmentation of the *Subdiv Terrain* program. 

* The whole code has been passed in 3D coordinates. 

* The reset of the Command Buffer value used as atomic counter and as instance count is now done locally on GPU (`glCopyNamedBufferSubData`) for performance reasons

* Additionnal preprocessing step: The indices from the mesh triangles are reordered s.t. p[0] faces the longest edge (optimizes area balance in the created children when subdividing)

* Load of a real world **`.obj` mesh**, and enough buffer reloading functions have been implemented to allow the user to switch between mesh and terrain on the fly.

* Lots of refractoring

* New color mode implemented: Primitive Highlight, showing the primitives handled by the QuadTree, and the primitive uploaded from the CPU (*_i.e._* each leaf primitive can be a single triangle, or a triangle that already has `n` subdivision, with vertices and indices precomputed and stored in a VAO, therefore incrementing every primitive's final LoD by `n`).

Limitations of the Distance Based Approach
-------------------------
As previously mentioned, one of the leading approach to tessellation is aiming at a constant number of primitives per rendered pixel. This goal is intuitively compatible with a LoD computed in function of the distance, as the projection matrix will, if a perspective is used as in most case, make far primitives small, and close primitives large. Nevertheless, this assumption infer a very strong constraint on the low poly mesh rendered (_i.e._ the 3D mesh before it gets tessellated), as the primitive should have relatively the same size. For this reason, the distance based approach works very well on regular grid that later gets displaced (e.g. terrain rendering), but can become very unsatisfactory when used on artist-designed meshes. 

To serve as demonstration, we use a polygonal mesh encoded once with regular primitive, and once with non regular primitives.
