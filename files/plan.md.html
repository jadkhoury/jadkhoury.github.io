**Surface Subdivision on Compute Shaders - Master Thesis Plan**

Jad Khoury, under the supervision of Jonathan Dupuy, Unity Technologies

_I put in italic with question mark the parts which relevance or placement was not obvious to me_

# Introduction
* Define Surface Subdivision
* Define the problem with current real time implementation [Research to do]
* State our contributions 
	* Subdiv level virtually infinite (float precision)
	* Fully Adaptive
	* No need to preprocess meshes
* Present the plan 

<!-- *************************************************************************************** -->
# Quadtree: How to generate and delete geometry

## Intuition
* Explain intuitive idea behind quadtree
* Explain recursive algorithm
* State few used example and usual implementation [Research to do]
* Explain 1 quadtree per mesh prim
* Explain mappings from leaf primitive to final World-Space position

## Previous Work: Linear Quadtre
* Idea: Numerate the tess rule
* Explain the key updates (divide & merge)
* _Explain key data structure ? `vec4`, 2 ints concatenated..._
* _Explain Buffers (SSBOs & Atomic Counter)?_
* Explain how to recover transform from the key
* _Explain restricted tree constraint ? Or leave it for LoD ?_

## Contribution: Adapted to triangles
* _Explain new keys with MSB for level?_
* Detail new Tessellation Pattern
* Buffers used the same way
* Explain why and how I reimplemented the transform recovering from the key 

<!-- *************************************************************************************** -->

# LoD Function: Where do we need more geometry

## Intuition
* Explain why we need an LoD function
* State goals of our LoD function
	* _Explain restricted tree constraint ? Or leave it for Lin. QT. ?_ 
	* Poly / px ratio to reach

## Previous Work: Distance Based
* Intuition behind distance based
* CDLOD Approach [Read the article again]
* _T-Junction removal: morph zones ?_
* _Results ? Or leave it for Result section?_
* Problem with distance based: assume regular meshes

## Contribution: Screen-Space based
* Explain metric
* Say it's often used with Tess Shaders
* Explain triangulation (recall mapping stuff)
* _Results ? Or leave it for Result section?_

# T-Junction Removal: How to remove cracks from new geometry

## Intuition: 
* T-Junctions => cracks
* Insight: merge triangles

## Approach: 
* Advantage of triangulation [Really need a clear way to explain that...]
* Neighbour LoD evaluation 
	* _Do I explain the 3 methods or just the latest one?_
	* Explain chosen neighbour LoD check method(s)
* Removing the t-junction: 
	* _Morph / detroy bit in key `vec4` ? Or leave it for implementation details ?_
	* Morphing the triangles

# Implementation details

## Program structure: multiple passes 

### First approach: 3 passes
* Explain Compute Pass role
	* How it works
* Explain Cull Pass role
	* How it works
* Explain Render Pass role
	* How it works
	* Why it is so expensive

### Second approach: Merge cull and compute pass
* How I did it
* Perf advantages (almost free culling)
* _Explain copy pass here? Doesn't make sense without buffers explanations but would still fit in here_

## Buffer Architecture

### First approach
* Array of indirect command buffers
* Atomic increment in value
* Explain cycling 
* _Is `command` class explanation relevant?_

### Second approach
* Same arrays
* only bind the relevant value as atomic counter
* Still iterates through arrays of indirect commands

### Third approach
* Array of atomic counter
* One draw indirect command buffer, one dispatch indirect buffer
* Variable number of dispatch
* Explain new cycling
* _Explain copy pass here?_

## Key decoding
* _Explain key data structure here or when I explain quadtrees?_
* Explain reading branching by branching
* Explain transform accumulation 
* _Explain bit-wise operations to optimise transform computing?_


## Neighbour LoD check
* If not explained before, explain here

## _Further Optimisations ?_
* Concatenation of two ints to hav longs without external OpenGL API
* I'll find more stuff to put here if the section is relevant 

# Results
* We need to discuss what I put in here and what I compare to [Research to do]
* How to get some error metrics ? [Research to do]

# Future Work
* Catmull Clark
* Idea to investigate: Last few subdivision done on Compute Shader
* Idea to investigate: ROAM paper and subdivision scheme
* Implement variable size SSBOs
* Implementation in Unity Game Engine (Christoph Riccio proposed to help)
